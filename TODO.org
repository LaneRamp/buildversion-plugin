* NEXT? Build minimal and clean Mojo in Clojure
* TODO implement extraction of current version from git tags
* TODO Write Mojo integration test
** DONE put together git repo as fixture
** Each test checks out a particular version and copies a pom.xml onto it
** TODO write sample pom.xml/project
** TODO Hook it with maven-invoker-plugin
** Use TDD
*** pick unit testing framework for clojure
*** May be we need to use zi (or clojure-maven-plugin) to be able to run tests
** Impl1: shelling out to "git" command
** Impl2: how about using JGit ?
* TODO Call version-extraction logic from Mojo
* TODO Learn a bit about Plexus and how Maven uses it
** TODO Figure out what clojure-maven-plexus-compiler is for exactly
