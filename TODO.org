* DONE Build minimal and clean Mojo in Clojure
* NEXT Rename project? buildversioning? versioning-properties-plugin?
* TODO Implement Mojo
** DONE Call GIT version-extraction logic from Mojo
** DONE Test on a basic project *from a brand new user* (with a clean ~/.m2)
** DONE Typo on clojure-maven/pom.xml's reference to clojars repo
** NEXT Hook it with maven-invoker-plugin
*** write basic assertion to validate Mojo integration
** TODO Improve sample pom.xml/project
*** add filtering of propeties file
*** add field on jar MANIFEST
* TODO Implement version extraction for GIT
** DONE put together git repo as fixture
** DONE pick unit testing framework for clojure
** DONE May be we need to use zi (or clojure-maven-plugin) to be able to run tests
** DONE Write tests to checkout a particular version and assert expected version
** DONE Implement simple version extraction to make tests pass
** DONE Implement map with all type of versions we need
   * [X] artifact version
   * [X] full label (human)
   * [X] full packaging version (rpm)
   * [X] timestamp
** TODO Add validation if expected maven-artifact-version doesn't match project.version (configurable for failure or warning)
** TODO Make "walk first parent" logic configurable (cover both cases with tests)
** TODO Improve "first parent" impl to ensure it's fast on big repos
** TODO Complete test scenarios for corner cases
** TODO Make pattern of tstamp-version configurable
** SOMEDAY how about using JGit ?
* Propose a defmojo macro for clojure-maven project?
** DONE Implement
(defmojo
  "This is an example Maven Plugin written in Clojure"
  {:goal "simple"
   :requires-dependency-resolution "test"}

  ;; Mojo parameters
  base-directory   {:expression "${basedir}" :required true :readonly true}
  project          {:expression "${project}" :required true :readonly true}
  output-directory {:defaultValue "${project.build.outputDirectory}" :required true}
  xxx              {}

  ;; Do it!
  (execute [_]
       ;; 'log' and 'plugin-context' will be available automatically
       (.info log (str "* Infering project version *" output-directory))
       (.info log (str "* project.version = " (.getVersion project)))))
** DONE Move to clojure-maven and send pull-request upstream
** WAITING Improvements to have it accepted (like, better validations)
   * [X] Use vary-meta
   * [X] Write function keywords->JavaAnnotations, instead of hardcoded map
   * [X] Assume body is the body of the execute function
   * [X] and also wrap it in with-log
   * [X] Update example comment and move it to the documentation of defmojo definition
   * [X] Wrap mojo parameters in a vector
   * [X] Add beter validations
   * [X] Write basic unit tests
   * [X] Formatting max 80 columns
* TODO Generalize protocol for potential non-git implementations
* SOMEDAY Learn a bit about Plexus and how Maven uses it
