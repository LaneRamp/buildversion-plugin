* NEXT? Build minimal and clean Mojo in Clojure
* TODO implement extraction of current version from git tags
** DONE put together git repo as fixture
** DONE pick unit testing framework for clojure
** DONE May be we need to use zi (or clojure-maven-plugin) to be able to run tests
** DONE Write tests to checkout a particular version and assert expected version
** DONE Implement simple version extraction to make tests pass
** TODO Implement map with all type of versions we need
   * artifact version
   * full label (human)
   * full packaging version (rpm)
   * ?????
** TODO Complete test scenarios for all corner cases
* TODO Write Mojo integration test
** TODO Call version-extraction logic from Mojo
** TODO write sample pom.xml/project
** TODO Hook it with maven-invoker-plugin
*** write basic assertion to validate Mojo integration
* TODO Generalize protocol for potential non-git implementations
** separate mojo vs. core
* SOMEDAY how about using JGit ?
* TODO Learn a bit about Plexus and how Maven uses it
